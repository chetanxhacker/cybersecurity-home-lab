Components and Features.
Virtualized Environment: Set up a platform like Hyper-V, VMware, or VirtualBox.
Firewall: Use pfSense as the gateway for your networks.
Subnets: Create subnets for:
WAN (Internet access)
LAN (Kali Linux for penetration testing)
Monitoring Machines (Splunk, Wireshark)
Active Directory (Domain controller and clients)
Vulnerable Machines (e.g., Metasploitable)
Network Diagram: Draw a clear network diagram (e.g., using Lucidchart or draw.io).

Prerequisites for Building a Cybersecurity Home Lab
Hardware Requirements
The hardware setup depends on the number and complexity of virtual machines (VMs) you plan to run simultaneously. Hereâ€™s the recommended minimum:

1.1 System Requirements
CPU: Multithreaded processor with virtualization support (e.g., Intel Core i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/7).
Ensure virtualization is enabled in BIOS (Intel VT or AMD SVM).
RAM: Minimum 16 GB (32 GB recommended for better performance).
Storage: SSD with at least 500 GB free space (1 TB recommended).
VMs consume significant storage; allocate ~20 GB per VM.
Network Adapter:
Wired Ethernet connection for reliable internet access.
A USB Wi-Fi adapter (optional) for testing wireless attacks.
